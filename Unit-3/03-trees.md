# Trees

Trees are a common data structure in programming which are __hierarchical__ as opposed to __linear__. Trees are used to model all sorts of things, many of which you've interacted with already such as *filesystems* and the *HTML DOM* in web browsers.

Trees also have powerful specializations, such as Binary Search Trees, which are used to search ordered data; and Tries which are commonly used to encode dictionaries and spell checking algorithms.

## Objectives

* Describe Trees using specific vocabulary.
* Implement a Tree in JavaScript
* Implement some basic tree algorithms, specifically:
  * Depth First Search
  * Breadth First Search

## Linear vs Hierarchical Data Structures

So far the data structures we have seen are __linear__ and/or __sequential__ data structures that have a single starting point, and a single ending point. These linear structures follow a single __path__ from start to end. This single path contains all the elements in the data structure. Linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">Trees</a> are a data structure used to show hierarchical data. Like Linked Lists, these are modeled as a set of __nodes__ and __references__. Unlike Linked Lists, a node in a tree may have any number of __next references__, which we call __children__. All trees have a single starting point, called the __root node__ and nodes that have no children are called __leaf nodes__.

A Family Tree is a close analogy to trees in the computer science sense. In a family tree a __a parent node__ represents __both__ the mother and father. A leaf node would be a person without children in the biological sense of the word.

When thinking about trees, visualize them with the root at the top. Consider this tree:

![Binary Tree](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/pix/tree1.bmp)

> `8` here is the __root node__. The __root node__ has two __children__ `5` and `4`. This tree has four __leaf nodes__ `9`, `1`, `2`, and `3`, all of which have no children.

## Properties of Trees

In order for a set of __nodes__ and __children__ to be considered a __tree__ it must satisfy some  properties:

* Every node must have exactly __one__ parent,
* Except for the root node which cannot have a parent.

This means that in a Tree there is always a __single path__ from the __root node__ to any other node in the tree.

## Vocabulary

Trees have a lot of __domain specific language__, you may see these terms used:

- Root - node at the top of the tree.
- Parent - node above a node.
- Child - node below a node.
- Link - connection from a node to another node.
- Edge - another term for a __Link__.
- Grandparent - parent of parent.
- Grandchild - child of child.
- Sibling - children of same parent.
- Leaf Node - node that does not have a child.
- Internal Node - node that has a child.
- Ancestor/Descendent - the child or child of a child at any depth.
- Height/Max Depth - Number of edges in longest path from X to a leaf.
- Depth - length of the path from root to node X or number of edges in path from root to node X.

## Practice

For each of these facts, write a paragraph which proves it:

* The __height__ of a tree is equal to the longest path from root to leaf.
* In a tree with N nodes, there will always be N-1 edges.
* There is always a __single path__ from the __root node__ to any other node in the tree.
