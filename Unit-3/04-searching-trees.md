## Depth First Search for a Tree (DFS)

One of the most common ways of searching through a tree is using [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (DFS).

Here is an example of DFS Pre-order for a tree:

#### Pre-order vs In-order vs Post-order

Here is some potential step by step pseudo code for implementing DFS Pre-order (with a return value of an array of all the nodes - this can also be done with a callback for additional functionality)

1. Create an array called `data` to store our results
2. Create a variable called `current` and set it equal to the root
3. Define a function called `search` that takes in a node as a parameter. Inside of the function-
    - push into your `data` array the parameter passed into the function
    - if there is a node to the left, call the `search` function again passing in the node to the left
    - if there is a node to the right, call the `search` function again passing in the node to the right
4. Call the `search` function passing in the value of `current`
4. Return the array

For DFS, there are actually three ways to perform the operation! As we see in the gif above, these are called Pre-order, In-order and Post-order. To see the differences between these three, you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first) and [here](http://datastructuresnotes.blogspot.com/2009/02/binary-tree-traversal-preorder-inorder.html)

### Breadth First Search for a Tree (BFS)

[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS) is a strategy for searching in a tree in level order. BFS begins at a root node and inspects all the neighboring nodes. Then for each of those neighbor nodes in turn, it inspects their neighbor nodes which were unvisited, and so on. This is commonly implemented with a queue.

Here is an example of BFS in a tree:

Here is some potential step by step pseudo code for implementing BFS (with a return value of an array of all the nodes - this can also be done with a callback for additional functionality)

1. Create an array called `data` to store our results
2. Create a variable called `node` and set its value to be the root
3. Add this variable to your queue
4. Loop through your queue (as long as there is something in it)-
    - remove the first item in your queue (remember it is a FIFO structure)
    - push into the `data` array the value what has been dequeued
    - if there is a node to the left, add that node to the queue
    - if there is a node to the right, add that node to the queue
5. Return the array of data

### BFS or DFS?

Which is better? From [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3332947/when-is-it-practical-to-use-dfs-vs-bfs):

> That heavily depends on the structure of the search tree and the number and location of solutions (aka searched-for items). If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree, a breadth first search (BFS) might be better. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, depth first search (DFS) might take an extremely long time, but BFS could be faster. If the tree is very wide, a BFS might need too much memory, so it might be completely impractical. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree, BFS could be impractical. If the search tree is very deep you will need to restrict the search depth for depth first search (DFS), anyway (for example with iterative deepening).
