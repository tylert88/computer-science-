# Pointers

In lower level languages, when we want to access a variable we need to know its memory __address__ (you can think of this as a house address). A computer program can find a variable as long as it knows its memory address. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">Pointers</a> provide us a way to deal directly with these addresses. *A pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers directly to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address.*

However, pointers can be very challenging to manage and even used dangerously (overused) so that many higher level languages hide them entirely.

Here is an example of a linked list with pointers, demonstrating how you would implement pointers in a lower level language:
